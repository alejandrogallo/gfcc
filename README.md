# Green’s Function Coupled Cluster Library (GFCCLib)

GFCCLib is designed for the Green's function calculation of molecular system at the coupled-cluster level. 
The library is developed in the C++ programming language with a framework that enables scalability
(via scalable design of the algorithm), efficiency via multi-layer parallelism, memory management, and scheduling of tensor operations, and flexibility by providing a long-term sustainable platform for development of methods in this area on machines ranging from workstations to modern supercomputers.
